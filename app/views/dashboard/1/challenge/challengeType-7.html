            <p>You can make a challenge if you believe your property should be merged with others in to one or more properties.
                You'll need to make a challenge for each of the properties you want to merge.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Youll need to provide:</h2>

            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>an alternative ratable value for your property (or properties)</li>
                <li>the date that the properties should be merged</li>
                <li>rent details for the property (if it is rented)</li>
                <li>evidence that suports your suggested rateable value</li>
                <li>a statement that explains how your evidence supports your challenge and why your suggested rateable value is correct</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you don't include everything you need, we'll contact you to tell you that your challenge is incomplete. If it's not corrected within the time limit given, your challenge will be invalid.</p>
