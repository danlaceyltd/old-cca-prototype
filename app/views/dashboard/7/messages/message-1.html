                ID}.</p>
              <p>We have now created a case reference number for your check which you should use for all future

              <p>We aim to provide a response within 12 weeks. Some checks may take longer to resolve. We will
                prioritise your check if you are a smaller proposer. We will contact you with an outcome for your
                check.</p>
              <p>We may contact you if we need more information or evidence.</p>
              <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the information submitted as part of your check may cause the valuation to go up
                as well as down.</p>
