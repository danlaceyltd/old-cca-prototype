              <p>The check will be considered by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA). No further action is required
                at this time.</p>
              <p>We aim to provide a response within 12 weeks. Some checks may take longer to resolve. We will
                prioritise the check if your client is a smaller proposer. We will contact you and your client with an
                outcome for the check.</p>
              <p>We will contact you if we need more information or evidence.</p>
              <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the information submitted as part of your check may cause the valuation to go up
                as well as down.</p>
